This project presents a comprehensive analysis of my stock investment portfolio, covering the period from October 2023 to May 2025. The primary objective is to track portfolio performance, evaluate returns and risk, and derive insights into long-term investment behavior. The analysis is based on Virtual trading activity conducted via the StockGro platform, and includes both portfolio-level summaries and individual stock performance breakdowns.

As part of this project, I also implemented technical analysis methodologies to assess market trends and identify potential investment opportunities. By leveraging key technical indicators such as moving averages, RSI, MACD, and candlestick patterns, I developed structured entry strategies to enhance the precision of investment decisions and optimize trade timing.
Overall, this project combines practical experience with analytical techniques to demonstrate a strong foundation in equity research, portfolio management, and data-driven decision-making in financial markets.

The portfolio initially comprised a diversified set of equity holdings; however, based on evolving market conditions and continuous performance evaluation, it was strategically realigned to focus on two high-conviction investments: General Insurance Corporation of India and Suzlon Energy. This adjustment was driven by the goal of optimizing returns and consolidating capital into fundamentally and technically promising stocks.

The current composition represents a total investment of ₹6,24,800.00. As of the latest valuation, the portfolio’s market value has appreciated to ₹11,41,950.00, resulting in an unrealized profit of ₹5,17,150.00, which equates to an overall return of 82.77%. After factoring in a minor realized loss of ₹6,680.00 and transaction charges of ₹407.15, the portfolio demonstrates robust and efficient capital growth, reflecting both strategic decision-making and disciplined risk management.

Breaking it down further, the investment in General Insurance Corporation of India involved the purchase of 1,000 shares at an average price of ₹280.40. With the current market price at ₹407.00, this position has generated a profit of ₹1,26,600.00, achieving a return of 45.15%. On the other hand, Suzlon Energy has outperformed significantly, with 11,000 shares acquired at an average price of ₹31.31. The current market price stands at ₹66.85, resulting in a profit of ₹3,90,950.00, reflecting a strong return of 113.52%.

Using annualized volatilities of 49.67% for Suzlon Energy and 47.49% for GIC Re, along with portfolio weights of 55.1% and 44.9% respectively, and assuming a correlation coefficient of 0.3, the estimated portfolio risk is approximately 39.4%. This indicates a high level of volatility, primarily driven by Suzlon's aggressive price behavior. While the return potential is strong, this risk level highlights the need for diversification strategies, periodic rebalancing, and stop-loss mechanisms to mitigate downside exposure and protect capital.

The purpose of this project is not only to track financial growth but also to serve as a personal finance tool and a learning reference for long-term equity investing. It highlights the value of portfolio diversification, consistent tracking, and data-driven decision-making.

Overall, this project demonstrates practical skills in personal finance management, stock market analytics, and data interpretation—key areas that align with financial literacy and investment growth.
